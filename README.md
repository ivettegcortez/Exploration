# Exploration

For this project, I went with a _theme of exploring_ to different types of sceneries that one would like to sense. I chose to do 3 of the most likeable destinations that people would like to venture off to and work off that.  
It’ll start off with a home page that cuts off into 3 sections, each having a _feather for city life, flower for tropical life, and a leaf for nature life._ Once selected, the item will appear floating down through the sky and land next to its related subject, casting a view of the overall scenery.  
> For the city, it would be the feather floating down with a night background, and then land next to a pigeon on a railing watching the city view from the water.  
> For tropical, it would be the flower floating down the clouds and resting down on this woman’s hula flower headband.  
> For nature, it would be the leaf going down in sunset background colors, landing next to an eagle sitting on a cliff watching the view of the mountains and such. I will be using HTML Canvas for the backgrounds, JavaScript for the wind movements, and SVG graphics for specific items.
